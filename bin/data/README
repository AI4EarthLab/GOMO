# Input data
The NetCDF file seamount65_49_21.nc is the input file of Seamount case. The seamount problem proposed by Beckman and Haidvogel is a widely used ideal test case for regional ocean models (Beckmann and Haidvogel, 1993). It is a stratified Taylor column problem, which simulates the flow over an isolated seamount with a constant salinity and a reference vertical temperature stratification. An eastward horizontal current of 0.1 m/s is added at model initialization. The southern and northern boundaries are closed. If the Rossby number is small, an obvious anticyclonic circulation is trapped by the mount in the deep water.
